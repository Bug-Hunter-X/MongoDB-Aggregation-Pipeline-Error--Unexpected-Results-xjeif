# MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline Bug
This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using MongoDB aggregation pipelines: producing unexpected results due to incorrect usage of pipeline stages or operators.

The `bug.js` file contains an example of an aggregation pipeline that does not produce the expected results. The `bugSolution.js` file shows the corrected version.

## How to Reproduce

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Ensure you have MongoDB installed and running.
3.  Populate a collection named `myCollection` with sample data.
4.  Run `bug.js` to see the incorrect output.
5.  Run `bugSolution.js` to see the corrected output.

## Bug Description

The original aggregation pipeline incorrectly uses the stages, resulting in an unintended outcome.  The corrected version addresses the improper use of operators or stages and delivers the anticipated outcome.
